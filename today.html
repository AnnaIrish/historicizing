       <blockquote cite="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/flexbox-interfaces-tracks-case-study/"><i>The days of floats and margin trickery are finally behind us, as CSS furnishes developers with new and improved properties perfect for those delicate layouts. Layout features such as vertical alignment, evenly distributed spacing, source-order control and other patterns such as "sticky" footers are quite effortless to achieve with Flexbox.
       <br> - Dennis Gaebel Jr</i></blockquote>
       <p>When HTML and CSS were originally created they were meant for documents not applications.  CSS’s ability for page layout had a difficult start. Several intricate hacks developed to solve basic problems like floats for a two-page layout and display: table to lay things out horizontally. These different methods would all do virtually the same thing in very different ways and if one method did not work, you would need to know another one. Flexbox fixes a lot of these problems. It has four parts: direction, alignment, ordering, and flexibility. Typically, direction on a page goes from top to bottom. With Flexbox, direction can go top to bottom, bottom to top, left to right, and right to left. All directions render the same way. In CSS alignment can be a problem making it difficult to vertically center something. Flexbox solves this with one property. Flexbox lets you put your source in whatever order you want to. The order can be arbitrarily reordered in the document. Flexbox’s flexibility derives from its ability to tell an item to take up whatever space is leftover. This can be hacked with hidden overflow elements and positioning them next to a float but it only works in a few cases.</p>
