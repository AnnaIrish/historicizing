  <div class="overview">
     <div class="blocktext">
       <p>In [title], Haas describes the simple replacement model which assumes that old and new technologies are clearly differentiated from one another, both theoretically and in practice, and that new technologies simply replace older, obsolete technologies. The simple replacement model does not work does not concur within the scope of my project. Flexbox has worked its way up to becoming a W3C candidate recommendation. It has existed and does exist within the realm of other types of grid systems, mainly grid. Flexbox has not replaced Grid; they are both supported and have different uses. While Flexbox may be better for aligning items, Grid is better for complex layouts. A "simple replacement" of technologies does not exist. Flexbox is still developing from its initial working draft. It is becoming easier to do 2D layouts with Flexbox and the more designers play around with it and create tutorials, the more possibilties Flexbox can offer.</p>
