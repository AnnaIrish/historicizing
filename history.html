  	   <p>Flexbox’s first working draft came out July 23rd, 2009. The original spec (specification) is based on XUL, the technology Firefox uses to produce its UI (user interface). The spec included layout primitives that were easier to use than just plain HTML for interface design. Flexbox’ layout capability was thought to be useful for webpages as well. The basic XUL flex content was translated into a CSS spec that is seen in the 2009 working draft. There were several problems with the first working draft. The layout algorithm was slow, the spec was vague, and between its two implementations, Webkit and Firefox, there were divergent details. The spec worked differently between Webkit and Firefox even with basic components.</p>
