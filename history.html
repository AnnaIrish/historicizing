  	   <p>CSS Working Group discussed the idea for the flexible box model sometime before 2008. Flexbox’s first working draft was published on July 23rd, 2009. The original spec (specification) is based on XUL, the technology Firefox uses to produce its UI (user interface). The spec included layout primitives that were easier to use than just plain HTML for interface design. Flexbox’ layout capability was thought to be useful for webpages as well. The basic XUL flex content was translated into a CSS spec that is seen in the 2009 working draft. There were several problems with the first working draft. The layout algorithm was slow, the spec was vague, and between its two implementations, Webkit and Firefox, there were divergent details. The spec worked differently between Webkit and Firefox even with basic components.</p>
       <p>In 2011, Tab Atkins takes over as editor for the Flexbox spec. He does a significant revision of the syntax and publishes two working drafts within the year. The unofficial syntax from 2011 is referred to as the “tweener” syntax, which is supported in Chrome, Opera, and IE 10.  The display from the 2009 to 2011 syntax changed from box to flexbox.</p>
       <p>The Flexbox spec becomes a W3C candidate recommendation in 2012. Again, the syntax is edited and Opera releases un-prefixed support. Mozilla is close to releasing an un-prefixed support at this time.</p>
